# Aircraft-Analysis
I have created a code to plot a aircrafts minimum thrust to weight ratio required during take-off, Lift-off speed as a function of wing loading, Sensivity of minimum thrust to weight required for take off, change in elevation height and other parameters of an aircraft. this was done by python programming language using ADRpy, numpy and matplotlib.pyplot libraries. this was my project in my internship.
